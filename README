attempt to learn hearst patterns from english side of lexicons

* use srilm to get ngrams and counts
* write a script that masks out all but m words in ngrams and expand counts
* calculate tfidf vs natural english corpora

10/25/16

get patterns from english side of dict and english text:
scripts/getpatterns.py -d tur.engside.toklc --basefile bolt.ce.100k.sample --basengramfile bolt.100k.3g.12.base -o tur.3g.12.100k.toklc.tfidf -m 1 2 -n 3 &
scripts/getpatterns.py -d tur.engside.toklc --basefile bolt.100k.6g.12.base --no-basetext -o tur.6g.12.100k.toklc.tfidf.redo &

run test that applies patterns and also subsamples them:
scripts/runtest.py -l lextmp/BOLT_Turkish_RL_LDC2014E115_V2.1/lexicon -t tur.engside.toklc -p tur.6g.12.100k.toklc.tfidf.redo -o tur.6g.12.test.redo
todo:
  * write a simpile paren/comma/semicolon parser as a contrastive
  * get to a good point with the automated script and then compare outputs on turkish. also compare on uzbek/hausa
  * expand dictionary scrapes considerably
issues:
  * need more patterns of various lengths to capture pretty simple phenomena but looks like we're getting good stuff that a human wouldn't get without lots of work
  * speed of doing lots of patterns: logical or?
  * human scoring

speed hard to maintain. also, scores as they are now are annoying to deal with; better score needed
let's try ngrams of various sizes with various dropouts (3-6 with 1-n-1 per) and high thresh

TODO: put this onto hpc and parallelize the input to speed things up
TODO: combined ngrams version is probably overcounting since a pattern can come up via various ngrams; best to make them individually and use the max

RL approach; may not need patterns.
given a word and translation, make a decision on what words from the translation to use and whether to inflect the word.
do that for all the words in the lexicon, and apply them to a test set. get bleu-1.
rl magic to change some settings and try again.

let's try it for hausa!

first see if it can be done: get a sample sentence and detect coverage.

hausa doesn't seem to be working well so far...
turkish either. uzbek is ok.

should make two-sided trie of morphologically rich words to identify most likely prefix/suffixes (compare to frequency statistics from other languages to eliminate simple things like 'a'.

1) need to make a language of transformation. selection of english word sequences and inflection (/selection?) of foreign words. # of items allowed per entry.
2) given a selection and a corpus, cover the corpus and score coverage
3) hook this into a framework that allows selection modification, updates.


let's try a sample uzbek sentence: (hpc ~/LE/mt2/v4/uzb/sbmt/test.[source,target] line 1; lots of mismatched data in this set!)

Tibbiy xizmat koʻrsatish sifatining oshishi , aholining tibbiy madaniyati yuksalishi tufayli mamlakatimizda yuqumli kasalliklar yildan - yilga kamayib bormoqda .

translation:

Thanks to improvement of quality of health service and the level of medical culture of the population , the number of infectious diseases cases decreases in Uzbekistan .

seems ok.

how to connect it up? need a model for determining whether a word is on or off

x^1 -> y_1^1 y_2^1 ... y_n^1
choose e.g. y_1^1 y_3^1. We want, for any y_i^1, p(y_i^1|...)
context can be source word and adjacent targets. Could do RNN/LSTM model with input vector = x, y_i-1, y_i+1, y_i-2, y_i+2.... with special stop at end of shortest.
simple single layer then predicts on/off. Each element discrete.

TODO: tf or other
